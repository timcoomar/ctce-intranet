City to City Europe is a trans-denominational network of urban churches and church plants committed to fostering a movement of the gospel in the cities of Europe. The following values unite us:

### The Gospel
We believe the historic Gospel of Jesus is both the key to the salvation and transformation of individuals spiritually, and should be the driving force in all of life, work and ministry. Understanding and applying its implications is vital to addressing all problems of the human condition and to shaping every ministry of the church.

### The City
We believe cities are important to God’s redemptive plan, part of the good creation of God and strategic places for gospel ministry. As such they should receive priority at this point in history, particularly in light of the fact that they are underserved and disproportionately influential.

### Church Multiplication
We believe the church remains God’s chosen means to proclaim the gospel and to demonstrate God’s love and mercy in the world. While seeking to encourage the healthy development of existing churches, we are committed to planting culturally relevant, urban churches that effectively contextualize the ministry of the gospel for the community and setting in which they are formed. The planting of new congregations is important for the growth of the Body of Christ within a city and for the impact of the gospel on the culture of that city.

### Holistic Ministry
We believe the Scriptures compel us both to proclaim the gospel in word, and to demonstrate the implications of the gospel in deed: seeking justice, loving mercy and promoting truth and righteousness in the culture.

### Local Leadership
We are committed to helping raise up church planting leaders local to the various cultural milieus in the cities of Europe. Generally they will have a greater ability to parse their own culture and to apply the gospel effectively to their culture than outsiders brought in to do gospel ministry. While there may be need to target specific groups of people of similar cultural background and orientation in the cities, there is also great need for churches that will reflect the cultural and socio-economic diversity of people living in the cities.
